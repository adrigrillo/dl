# Deep Learning Course 2019
### Assignment 1:

Download the Iris data and explore it.
- [ ] Analyse and visualize the dataset. How many classes, instances, features, etc...

Select feature number 0 and 2 and the first samples and do the following analysis: 

- [ ] Implement the logistic regression model that discussed in the class (with and
without regularization). Use Gradient descent algorithm for updating the parameters.
Plot the results.
- [ ] Explore the influence of learning rate on the convergence of the model.
Tune the learning rate.
- [ ] Repeat steps 1-4 for different randomly selected features (e.g. 1 and 3 or 2 
and 3. and compare the results.
- [ ] Give the option to the users to select whatever combination of features they
want and your code will do the rest.
- [ ] Try your model on Monk2 dataset and report the results, (test accuracy, 
training accuracy, optimal learning rate, loss value... Use the last 20% of the
data as test.

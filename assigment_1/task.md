# Deep Learning Course 2019
## Assignment 1:

Download the Iris data and explore it, (visualize it, how many classes, 
instances, features, etc.. Select feature number 0 and 2 and the first
100 samples and do the following analysis: 

1. Implement the logistic regression model that discussed in the class (with and
without regularization). Use Gradient descent algorithm for updating the parameters.
Plot the results.

2. Explore the influence of learning rate on the convergence of the model.
Tune the learning rate.

3. Repeat steps 1-4 for different randomly selected features (e.g. 1 and 3 or 2 
and 3. and compare the results.

4. Give the option to the users to select whatever combination of features they
want and your code will do the rest.

5.  Try your model on Monk2 dataset and report the results, (test accuracy, 
training accuracy, optimal learning rate, loss value.. Use the last 20% of the
data as test.
